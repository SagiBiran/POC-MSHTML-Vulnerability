\Once a victim click on document.docx, Windows generates the preview of the file content by
spawning a hidden window of Microsoft Word (WINWORD.exe) then the DLL exploit payload
(msword.inf) is automatically and silently loaded into victim operating system as describe:
WINWORD.exe->control.exe ->rundll32.exe. For demonstration purposes we load the
clac.exe.

\Our mitigating attack method was to find the silently loaded system call
(control.exe->rundll32.exe) and terminate the process before the dll loader.
